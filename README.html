</ul>
<h2><a href="#why-" name="why-"></a>Why?</h2>
<p>In addition to raw features, some reasons you may want to use Franzy:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Comprehensive Kafka client</li>
  <li>Extreme care to not remove, distort, break, or diminish anything in the existing Java API</li>
  <li>Sane balance of performance vs. Clojure best-practices vs. ease-of-use</li>
  <li>Does not force any viewpoint about producing, consuming, administration, etc. on you beyond what Kafka already does</li>
  <li>À la carte - Lots of goodies and sugar, even for projects that are using mostly Java or don’t need the consumer or producer at all. Build out what you need, no more, no less.</li>
  <li>Currently being used in a real project, where Kafka is the “spine” of the application, and thus, must be updated, fixed, and changed as needed</li>
  <li>Relatively future proof</li>
  <li>Designed to be a good fit with stream processors, particularly <a href="https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx">Onyx</a></li>
  <li>See <a href="https://github.com/ymilky/franzy/blob/master/doc/rationale.md">Rationale</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#requirements" name="requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>
<p>Requirements may vary slightly depending on your intended usage.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clojure 1.8+ - You may be able to compile this library on/with earlier versions, but this is untested.</li>
  <li>Kafka 0.9+ - Some parts may work on earlier versions, but this is untested.</li>
</ul>
<p>A good way to get started with Kafka is to use Docker and/or Vagrant. I recommend using a Docker compose stack with Kafka and Zookeeper that lets you scale up/down to test.</p>
<p>Here’s at least one to get started, feel free to submit more:</p>

<h2><a href="#usage" name="usage"></a>Usage</h2>
<p>The best way to learn is <a href="https://github.com/ymilky/franzy-examples">Franzy Examples</a> and viewing the <a href="http://ymilky.github.io/franzy/">API docs</a>, source, etc.</p>
<p>Below are a few naive examples to get you started.</p>
<h3><a href="#serialization" name="serialization"></a>Serialization</h3>
<p>You’ll need to pick a format in/out of Kafka.</p>
<p>I recommend you use <a href="https://github.com/ymilky/franzy-nippy">Franzy-Nippy</a>, but think carefully about your use-case. If you’re just getting started, the built-in EDN Serializer is a good choice to keep things simple. Of course, all the built-in serializers in Kafka are accessible as well.</p>
<p>For the built-in serializers/deserializers, simply do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(my.ns
  (:require [franzy.serialization.deserializers :as deserializers]
            [franzy.serialization.serializers :as serializers]))
</code></pre>
<p>For the add-ons you’ll have to reference them as separate dependencies obviously. They follow a pattern like this, replacing <code>nippy</code> with the serializer/deserializer name:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(my.ns
  (:require [franzy.serialization.nippy.deserializers :as deserializers]
            [franzy.serialization.nippy.serializers :as serializers]))
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/ymilky/franzy/blob/master/doc/serialization.md">Serializers</a> for a discussion.</p>
<h3><a href="#producers" name="producers"></a>Producers</h3>
<p>Creating a producer, using some options just like in a Kafka properties file, but more Clojure-like:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(let [pc {:bootstrap.servers ["127.0.0.1:9092"]
          :retries           1
          :batch.size        16384
          :linger.ms         1
          :buffer.memory     33554432}
      ;;normally, just inject these direct and be aware some serializers may need to be closed,
      ;; adding to binding here to make this clear
      key-serializer (serializers/string-serializer)        ;;Serializes producer record keys as strings
      value-serializer (serializers/string-serializer)      ;;Serializes producer record values as strings
      ]
  (with-open [p (producer/make-producer pc key-serializer value-serializer)]
    (partitions-for p "test")))

;;=&gt;
[{:topic "test",
  :partition 0,
  :leader {:id 1001, :host "127.0.0.1", :port 9092},
  :replicas [{:id 1001, :host "127.0.0.1", :port 9092}],
  :in-sync-replicas [{:id 1001, :host "127.0.0.1", :port 9092}]}]
</code></pre>
<p>Synchronous and asynchronous production, using a different producer arity:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(let [;;Use a vector if you wish for multiple servers in your cluster
      pc {:bootstrap.servers ["cliffs-of-insanity.guilder:9092" "fire-swamp.guilder:9092"]}
        ;;Serializes producer record keys that may be keywords
        key-serializer (serializers/keyword-serializer)
        ;;Serializes producer record values as EDN, built-in
        value-serializer (serializers/edn-serializer)
        ;;optionally create some options, even just use the defaults explicitly
        ;;for those that don't need anything fancy...
        options (pd/make-default-producer-options)
        topic " land-wars-in-asia "
        partition 0]
    (with-open [p (producer/make-producer pc key-serializer value-serializer options)]
      (let [send-fut (send-async! p topic partition :inconceivable {:things-in-fashion
                                                                    [:masks :giants :kerry-calling-saul]} options)
            record-metadata (send-sync! p " land-wars-in-asia " 0 :conceivable
                                        {:deadly-poisons [:iocaine-powder :ska-music :vegan-cheese]}
                                        options)
            ;;we can also use records to produce, wrapping our per producer record value (data) as usual
            record-metadata-records (send-sync! p (pt/-&gt;ProducerRecord topic partition :vizzini
                                                                       {:quotes [" the battle of wits has begun!"
                                                                                 "finish him, your way!" ]})
                                                options)]
        (println " Sync send results: " record-metadata)
        (println " Sync send results w/record: " record-metadata-records)
        (println "Async send results: " @send-fut))))

<h3><a href="#consumer-overview" name="consumer-overview"></a>Consumer Overview</h3>
<p>In order to consume data from Kafka, you must have one or more valid partitions per topic assigned. There are 2-ways to get a partition assignment from Kafka - manually and automatically.</p>
<p>The manual-assignment case is well suited to users who are tracking offsets manually or want to override and commit offset positions. Automatic assignment is performed via subscription and best used when storing offsets in Kafka itself.</p>
<p>The process to consume data from Kafka follows a pattern something like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setup threads for consuming</li>
  <li>Assign or Subscribe (Automatically assign) at least one partition from a given topic to the consumer</li>
  <li>Resume consumption from last committed offset or seek to a specific offset to determine where consumptions begins</li>
  <li>Begin consuming by polling in a polling thread, repeating this step to the end of time</li>
  <li>Close the consumer when finished (or time itself ends)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is vitally important that you undestand the implicaitons of threading, polling, partition assignments, and offsets. This is documented in the official <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html">Kafka</a> docs, go read it, now, and the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/090/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html">consumer Java API</a> docs too.</p>
<p>This is perhaps an over-simplification as there are a few other nuances.</p>
<p>For the impatient among you, the major differences between the “manual” consumer and “subscription” or “automatic” consumer are generally offset management and partition assignment.</p>
<p>Franzy lets you choose, and there’s nothing stopping you from manually assigning offsets. Likewise, there’s nothing stopping you from committing offsets to Kafka itself manually (rather than Zookeeper, Redis, Aerospike, Cassandra, etc.).</p>
<p>You will find most of what works for the manual and subscription consumers is the same. The details are mainly in which protocols you use. If you want to force one paradigm over another, simply don’t call or require the protocols of the other.</p>
<p>It is extremely important to note that consuming via subscriptions and using manual assignments are mutually exclusive. If you attempt to do so at the same time, your code will fail. Although Kafka itself will protect you from any adverse effects of this behavior by throwing an exception, it is not guaranteed that this behavior will remain in future versions as the Kafka API changes.</p>
<p>The examples given here do not create threads for the sake of simplicity. I leave this as an exercise to you as your use-cases will determine your threading model. My colleagues and I prefer to use core.async which makes it simple to transduce results directly on to a channel, manage thread lifecycles, etc. We’ve also used core.async with Manifold to great success. Understand that when you poll, work with offsets, etc., many of these are blocking operations.</p>
<h3><a href="#manual-consumer" name="manual-consumer"></a>Manual Consumer</h3>
<p>Below, we create a manual consumer and demo a bit of the important assignment capabilities you might want to use when working with a manual consumer:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">  (let [cc {:bootstrap.servers ["127.0.0.1:9092"]
            :group.id          "hungry-eels"
            :auto.offset.reset :earliest}
        ;;notice now we are using keywords, to ensure things go as we planned when serializing
        key-deserializer (deserializers/keyword-deserializer)
        ;;notice now we are using an EDN deserializer to ensure we get back the data correctly
        value-deserializer (deserializers/edn-deserializer)
        options (cd/make-default-consumer-options)
        topic "land-wars-in-asia"
        ;;notice, we are setting the topics and partitions to what we produced to earlier...
        topic-partitions [{:topic topic :partition 0}]]
    (with-open [c (consumer/make-consumer cc key-deserializer value-deserializer options)]
      ;;first, lets get some information about the currently available topic partitions...
      ;;we will see a list of topics, along with partition info for each one
      (println "Topic Partition Info per Topic:" (list-topics c))
      ;;maybe you just want an eager list of topics, that's it....a simple solution with many possible solutions
      (println "An inefficient vector of topics:" (-&gt;&gt; (list-topics c)
                                                       ;;or (keys), but here we want to stringify our keys a bit
                                                       (into [] (map (fn [[k _]] (name k))))))
      ;;something more specific in scope
      (println "Topic Partitions for our topic:" (partitions-for c topic))
      ;;now let us manually assign a partition
      ;;if you really wanted some dynamic behavior, you could use some of the results above from list-topics
      (assign-partitions! c topic-partitions)
      ;;list the assigned partitions - shocking revelations follow:
      (println "Assigned Partitions:" (assigned-partitions c))
      ;;now lets say we don't like to be labeled, and thus, we don't want any more assignments
      (println "Clearing partition assignments....")
      (clear-partition-assignments! c)
      (println "After clearing all partition assignments, we have exactly this many assignments (correlates to wall-street accountability):"
               (assigned-partitions c))))
</code></pre>
<h3><a href="#subscription-based-consumer" name="subscription-based-consumer"></a>Subscription-based Consumer</h3>
<p>Below, we create a subscription-based consumer that auto-commits its offsets to Kafka. A point of interest that applies both to the subscription-based consumer and the manual consumer is working with consumer records.</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(let [cc {:bootstrap.servers       ["127.0.0.1:9092"]
          :group.id                "submissive-blonde-aussies"
          ;;jump as early as we can, note this isn't necessarily 0
          :auto.offset.reset       :earliest
          ;;here we turn on committing offsets to Kafka itself, every 1000 ms

      topic "land-wars-in-asia"
      ;;Here we are demonstrating the use of a consumer rebalance listener. Normally you'd use this with a manual consumer to deal with offset management.
      ;;As more consumers join the consumer group, this callback should get fired among other reasons.
      ;;To implement a manual consumer without this function is folly, unless you care about losing data, and probably your job.
      ;;One could argue though that most data is not as valuable as we are told. I heard this in a dream once or in intro to Philosophy.

<h3><a href="#working-with-consumer-results" name="working-with-consumer-results"></a>Working with Consumer Results</h3>
<p>You may have noticed in earlier examples we were binding the result set and then doing operations like take, into, etc. on it. That’s because Kafka returns richer results than just a map, though you can simply skip the binding and use a map if you like.</p>
<p>Consumers get results by polling Kafka until a timeout, then repeating over-and-over. The consumer will get what it asks for based on the position of the consumer and other consumers influencing this within its consumer group. A poll will return “consumer records” which is an object containing 0 or more instances of “consumer record” objects. Franzy uses records to represent these for speed, memory footprint, and ease of use.</p>
<p>If you don’t understand how consumers with Kafka work, you must read more in the official <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html">Kafka</a> documentation. This is crucial for any Kafka client library to be useful and not seem “broken” to you.</p>
<p>A common problem that new Kafka users have is that they do not understand the consumption model. Many new users assume the server or the client library must be broken when no results are returned. Take a moment, ensure you understand, read through <a href="http://wwww.github.com">franzy-examples</a>, and try some examples interactively with your cluster.</p>
<p>The following capabilities are available to you when working with consumer records:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lazy/Non-lazy chunked/unchunked access to results from Kafka, with optional transducers applied without excessive intermediate objects.</li>
  <li>Full fidelity of the results returned from Kafka (by topic, partition, all, record count, and future additions from the Java side). Nothing lost, much gained.</li>
  <li>Ability to further slice records via transducer or by calling built-in functions to slice on topic or topic partition.</li>
  <li>Preservation of the result type and referential transparency of results from Kafka. No inadvertent consumption of iterators or eagerly realizing things if not desired.</li>
  <li>Ability to call seq operations via Seqable implementation, and return only Clojure types consistent with the rest of the API.</li>
  <li>Ability to reduce the result set itself in a high performance way via IReduceInit, and return only Clojure types consistent with the rest of the API.</li>
  <li>Frees client implementations, testing, etc. from dealing with this behavior - no complecting the client implementation with handling the result set behavior.</li>
  <li>Ability to override the result set output by introducing your own conversions early in sequence creation or by extending the codec protocol used for result conversions.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#offset-management" name="offset-management"></a>Offset Management</h3>
<p>Franzy supports both automatically committing offsets to Kafka and manually managing offsets yourself.</p>
<p>Callbacks for offset commits, consumer rebalance events, and more are provided to help you with this process depending on your needs. If you are managing your own offsets, please use a highly available datastore that is reasonably fast. You may trade reliability for speed if you don’t care about losing data.</p>
<p>The following code demonstrates some offset management operations and gotchas with Kafkas that newcomers often struggle with:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(let [cc {:bootstrap.servers ["127.0.0.1:9092"]

      second-topic-partition {:topic topic :partition 1}
      topic-partitions [first-topic-partition second-topic-partition]]
  (with-open [c (consumer/make-consumer cc key-deserializer value-deserializer options)]
    ;;first we'll make sure we can assign some partitions. We could also subscribe instead, but for examples, this is easier.
    (assign-partitions! c topic-partitions)
    (seek-to-beginning-offset! c topic-partitions)
    ;;let's peek at what the next offset is.....it should be 0 if we're at the beginning
    (println "Next offset:" (next-offset c first-topic-partition))
    ;;now maybe we want to save some metadata about the beginning offset....
    ;;Notice, we're sending a map with the keys a topic partition map as the key, and the value as an offset metadata map
    (commit-offsets-sync! c {first-topic-partition {:offset 0, :metadata "In the beginning.....that was a long time ago."}})
    ;;Now let's have a peek at what we committed. If you've done this before, there might be other data obviously
    (println "Committed offsets so far:" (committed-offsets c first-topic-partition))
    ;;Now let's commit the next offset (there should be one if you produced data already), but this time async
    (commit-offsets-async! c {first-topic-partition {:offset 1 :metadata "Those who count from one, are but two."}})
    ;;Another peek at the results, but this might surprise you if your thinking cap is at the cleaners
    (println "Committed offsets after first async call:" (committed-offsets c first-topic-partition))
    ;;The problem here is you passed the offsets as the options map! Don't do it.
    ;; OK, if not then what about other arities?
    (commit-offsets-async! c {first-topic-partition {:offset 1 :metadata "Those who count from one, are but two."}} nil)
    (println "Committed offsets after proper async call:" (committed-offsets c first-topic-partition))
    ;;Nope, still no new data, but what about doing it sync
    (commit-offsets-sync! c {first-topic-partition {:offset 1 :metadata "Those who count from one, are but two."}})
    (println "Committed offsets after 2nd sync call:" (committed-offsets c first-topic-partition))
    ;;OK, great, doing it sync worked, but why?
    ;;Let's create some callbacks so we have a better idea what is going on
    ;;We could use these to do all kinds of fun stuff, like store this metadata in our own shiny database
    (let [occ (offset-commit-callback (fn [offset-metadata]
                                        (println "By the wind shalt be, commit succeeded:" offset-metadata))
                                      (fn [e]
                                        (println "Offsets failed to commit, just like you:" e)))]
      ;;notice the different arity and the fact we pass our callback.
      ;; We could have also just set this in the consumer options, in which case, there would be no need to use this arity
      ;; Unless the callback changed per-call, in which case, someone somewhere has read your code, then engaged the grumble-drive.
      (commit-offsets-async! c {first-topic-partition {:offset 2 :metadata "A Nancy to a Tanya"}} {:offset-commit-callback occ})
      (println "Committed offsets after async callback version:" (committed-offsets c first-topic-partition))
      ;;ok, why are there still no offsets?
      ;;let's try to follow the Franzy documentation! READ IT!
      ;;first, let's poll from offset 2, so we'll need to seek to it
      (seek-to-offset! c first-topic-partition 2)
      ;;and to poll, results are not important as long as we got at least 1 - you did populate the data, didn't you?
      (poll! c)
      (commit-offsets-async! c {first-topic-partition {:offset 2 :metadata "A Nancy to a Tanya"}} {:offset-commit-callback occ})
      (println "Committed offsets after listening to the doc about polling with async commits:" (committed-offsets c first-topic-partition))
      ;;all is well, that was certainly traumatic.....

<h3><a href="#metrics" name="metrics"></a>Metrics</h3>
<p>Producing and consuming from Kafka is not an exact science. Fortunately, Kafka provides a metrics API that you can use in addition to any self-collected metrics to help determine when to use back-pressure, spawn threads, kill threads, fire up new machines, etc.</p>
<p>The code for a producer and consumer uses the same protocol. The consumer case is demonstrated below.</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">  (let [cc {:bootstrap.servers ["127.0.0.1:9092"]
            :group.id          "mawage"}
        key-deserializer (deserializers/keyword-deserializer)
        value-deserializer (deserializers/edn-deserializer)
        options (cd/make-default-consumer-options)]
    (with-open [c (consumer/make-consumer cc key-deserializer value-deserializer options)]
      ;;Now let's say we want to know something about how consuming is going. Perhaps we are too greedy.
      ;;We can get a plethora of metrics, log them, exert back-pressure on the producer if needed, eject, etc.
      ;;All of this, by parsing this wonderful thing below. JMXers, rejoice.
      ;; If there is more of a demand, we can add more transducers, helpers, etc. for metrics
      ;;WARNING - prepare your REPL for a feast. You won't receive any real values unless you've kept the consumer consuming....
      (metrics c)))

;;=&gt; example output....truncated
{:name "io-ratio",
  :description "The fraction of time the I/O thread spent doing I/O",
  :group "consumer-metrics",
  :tags {:client-id "consumer-55"}} {:metric-name {:name "io-ratio",
                                                   :description "The fraction of time the I/O thread spent doing I/O",

                                     :value 0.0}
</code></pre>
<h3><a href="#partitioners" name="partitioners"></a>Partitioners</h3>
<p>The default partioners are provided if you want to pass them around in Clojure or for consumer configuration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Round Robin Assignor - <code>round-robin-assignor</code></li>
  <li>Range Assignor <code>range-assignor</code></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="clojure">(ns my.ns
  (:require [franzy.clients.consumer.partitioners :as partitioners]))
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to control how your partition assignments are laid-out and assigned to consumers, you can implement your own partitioner. A protocol is also available <code>FranzPartitionAssignor</code> that will allow you to write your partition assignor with a protocol, for example via defrecord or deftype. You can then call <code>make-partition-assignor</code> and it will turn your protocol into a valid interface implementation. You should prefer to simply implement the <code>PartitionAssignor</code> interface directly for better performance as the protocol is only meant as a crude-shim for existing code.</p>
<h3><a href="#types-records" name="types-records"></a>Types/Records</h3>
<p>Various concrete type implementations are scattered throughout Franzy and add-ons. Using these will in some cases give you a performance boost and/or reduced memory consumption, and avoid reflection in other cases. This is particularly relevant and beneficial if you find yourself allocating large batches of maps for production, consumption, admin bulk operations, offset management, etc.</p>
<p>Most records are stored in <code>types.clj</code> files across many namespaces. These correspond directly to the context they are used, i.e. common, consumer, producer, admin, etc.</p>
<p>For example, you can use the ProducerRecord Clojure record like-so:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(ns ms.ns
  (:require [franzy.clients.producer.types] :as pt))

;;allocating a few hundred thousand of these, it's just a record....  
(pt/-&gt;ProducerRecord topic partition my-glorious-key my-odoriferous-eminating-value)
</code></pre>
<p>More importantly, these can easily be validated since each type has a corresponding schema, usually in a <code>schema.clj</code> file.</p>
<h3><a href="#validation" name="validation"></a>Validation</h3>
<p>Franzy provides validation for all map structures and data types used. You may use this functionality even if you are not interested in the rest of Franzy.</p>
<p>Schemas for validation are created and validation using the excellent <a href="https://github.com/plumatic/schema">Schema</a> library.</p>
<p>Simple configuration validation example:</p>
<pre><code class="clojure">(let [cc {:bootstrap.servers ["127.0.0.1:9092"]}]
    (s/validate cs/ConsumerConfig cc))

;;valid config
;;=&gt; {:bootstrap.servers ["127.0.0.1:9092"]}

(let [cc {:bootstrap.servers ["127.0.0.1:8080"]
          :timeout.typo 123
          :auto.commit.interval.ms "forever"
          :auto.offset.reset nil}]
    (s/validate cs/ConsumerConfig cc))

;;=&gt; ExceptionInfo Value does not match schema: {:auto.offset.reset (not (#{:latest :earliest :none} nil)), :auto.commit.interval.ms (throws? (GreaterThanOrEqualToZero? "forever")), :timeout.typo disallowed-key}  schema.core/validator/fn--4313 (core.clj:151)
</code></pre>
<p>Schemas are constantly being tweaked and exist for the following so far:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Producer Configuration</li>
  <li>Consumer Configuration</li>
  <li>Broker Configuration</li>
  <li>Kafka Connect Configuration</li>
  <li>Topic Configuration</li>
  <li>Producer Types</li>
  <li>Consumer Types</li>
  <li>Admin Types</li>
  <li>Admin Zookeeper Types</li>
  <li>General Types used in Kafka</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the above will help you validate just about any map that comes in/out of Kafka should you choose. Validation can be toggled on/off thanks to schema and by your implementation.</p>
<h2><a href="#contributing-roadmap" name="contributing-roadmap"></a>Contributing/Roadmap</h2>
<p>This library is still very young and is surely filled with bugs. Pull requests are welcome.</p>
<p>Of particular concern/value to fix/refactor/enhance currently:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Schemas - raw, and while working, may have mistakes, which in part may be to incorrect Kafka documentation. While the Kafka source was used for some of the harder parts of this library, much of the schema came from reading the documentation. Many mistakes have already been caught. Moreover, as Kafka grows and changes, config values are often the most in flux.</li>
  <li>Serializers - More will be added as needed. Certainly the existing serializers can be enhanced and are meant as a blue-print and general usage. As your usage may vary, you may wish to fork or modify the existing serializers accordingly. In order to avoid this, options are easily injected into most serializers. Additional features can also be easily added by closing over values.</li>
  <li>Testing - more unit tests are required, but adding them is an ongoing effort.</li>
  <li>Field/Integration testing - If you’re using this library in the wild, it may be too early, but I’d love to hear from you and fix any problems.</li>
  <li>Async helpers, examples, particularly with core.async and/or manifold</li>
  <li>Useful transformations/eductions/transductions/whatever for working with the various data structures to/from Kafka</li>
</ul>
<p>Please be aware many problems/issues may be due to Kafka itself or the Java API. As such, before submitting issues, please check these issue trackers first. If there is a reasonable workaround or solution, please leave a note and link to the underlying issues.</p>
